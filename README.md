## ContactListApp (version 1.1) â€“ A simple MEAN stack application
A simple application for managing a contact list. This exercise served as my introduction to building on a MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node.js), and was completed by following the tutorial videos made by [Learn Coding Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX2HoWE32I8Nkzw2TqcifObuhgJZz8a0U)

## Instructions
The instructions are the mostly same as on the mentioned tutorial. You can clone this project by copying the clone URL and running the following code on your command line `git clone CLONE URL`

Download and install Node.js and then required node modules using `npm install`

Download and install MongoDB, open another command prompt (line), navigate to the MongoDB directory and then use the command `mongod` to start running the database

## Improved functionality - Edit through modals

The edit and update function for the application is performed through an AngularUI modal. Further instruction on setting up an Angular can be found on their [site](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/#/modal)

## Note!

You might see this error once you start up the application on your command prompt.
```
{[Error: cannot find module '../build/Release/bson'] code: ' MODULE_NOT_FOUND'}
js-bson: Failed to load c++ bson extension, using pure JS version
```

Don't worry about this message, the code will still work.
